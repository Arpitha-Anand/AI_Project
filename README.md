Image Colorization using Deep neural network

Image colorization can add color to photographs that were originally taken in black and white. 
▪ In this project we colorize the black and white image and apply some styles. 
▪ We have a grayscale image for the input, our final output is a colored image with two clarities ECCV 16 and SIGGRAPH 17. 
▪ ECCV 16 and SIGGRAPH 17 which are 2 pretrained modules which helps to modify the image clarity and color. 
▪ In preprocess and postprocess steps: the image resizes to 256x256, colorize, and concatenate to the original full resolution, and convert to RGB

Packages required:

▪ torch 
▪ skimage 
▪ numpy 
▪ matplotlib 
▪ argparse 
▪ PIL
